### 2020-05-22 - MSYS2 fails to start after a msys2-runtime upgrade

MSYS2 programs will fail to start if programs started before the update are
still running in the background (especially sshd, dirmngr, gpg-agent, bash,
pacman and mintty). You can stop them by running the following in a Windows
terminal:

```batch
taskkill /f /fi "MODULES eq msys-2.0.dll"
```

If that fails, try a reboot.

We've improved our update process so this shouldn't happen again with future
updates.
