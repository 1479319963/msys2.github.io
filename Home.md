If you have any problems with the POSIX side of MSYS2 (e.g. ssh, home directories, user accounts, native symlinks, signal handling, ...), try to consult the [Cygwin documentation](https://cygwin.com/docs.html) first, as a lot of what's written there applies to MSYS2 as well.

There is also an [excellent introduction from Matthieu Vachon](https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/discussion/general/thread/dcf8f4d3/#8473/588e) describing MSYS2, the shells, pacman and other stuff in a less technical, more practical way.
